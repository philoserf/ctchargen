# Changelog

## Unreleased

Bullets as the work lands. The release pass rewrites this into whatever the
release turns out to be.

## v1.0.0-beta.2 — 2026-09-08

The tracker is empty, and this is the shape `v1.0.0` will freeze. Nothing here
changes a character.

### Install

A binary, needing no Go toolchain. This is the line for an Apple-silicon Mac:

```sh
curl -Lo ctchargen https://github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.2/ctchargen-v1.0.0-beta.2-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ctchargen
```

Substitute `darwin-amd64`, `linux-amd64` or `linux-arm64` in the filename for
another machine; `checksums.txt` is attached beside them. A **browser**
download is quarantined and needs `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ctchargen`
first — `curl` is not. The binaries are **unsigned**, so a recent macOS may
refuse one regardless; if it does, the tool is not broken and
`go install github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/cmd/ctchargen@v1.0.0-beta.2` is the
way in.

### What a referee will notice

Nothing at the table. Every character this build generates is the character
beta.1 generated from the same seed. The two changes are to the record's
published schema and to the repository's own coverage gate.

That is what a last beta before a freeze looks like: the work is in what the
record promises rather than in what it says.

### What changed in the record

**`docs/character.schema.json` now describes the record `v1.0.0` will freeze.**

A record from a later build validates against it. The root object accepts a
top-level section this schema has never seen, and `record` — the field naming
the record's shape — accepts a number from the future rather than being pinned
to `1`. Both halves were needed: a reader that refused the shape number would
never have reached the new field it was meant to allow.

That is the point of a frozen record. A third party holding the `v1.0.0` schema
should be able to load a record written by a later build and render what it
understands, which is what `ctchargen render` already does for an event kind it
does not know — it prints `(unknown event kind …)` rather than failing.

**The record's own structures are still pinned.** A key added inside an event,
inside `enlistment`, inside a benefit, is refused exactly as before. Those are
what a sheet is rendered from, and pinning them is what keeps the schema worth
validating against. A later build may add a section; it may not quietly change
an event.

This build still writes `record: 1`, and there is now a test that says so.

### What this tag does not promise

**The freeze is not made.** `v1.0.0` means two things and only the first holds
today: a referee can trust what the tool prints at the table, and the record is
frozen and supported. A record written by this build is still not promised to
be readable by the next until that tag.

The shape is ready. The promise is what `v1.0.0` is for.

### Notes

**Do not install `v1.0.0-alpha.1` or `v1.0.0-alpha.2`.** Both predate the
rebuild at `41a213a` and are builds of a different implementation.

`docs/PRERELEASE.md` carries the full account, including the review that
preceded this tag and the four new gates broken on purpose.

## v1.0.0-beta.1 — 2026-09-05

The backlog is empty. Every milestone is closed, and this is the first tag to
ship with no finding open at any severity.

### Install

A binary, needing no Go toolchain. This is the line for an Apple-silicon Mac:

```sh
curl -Lo ctchargen https://github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.1/ctchargen-v1.0.0-beta.1-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ctchargen
```

Substitute `darwin-amd64`, `linux-amd64` or `linux-arm64` in the filename for
another machine; `checksums.txt` is attached beside them. A **browser**
download is quarantined and needs `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ctchargen`
first — `curl` is not. The binaries are **unsigned**, so a recent macOS may
refuse one regardless; if it does, the tool is not broken and
`go install github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/cmd/ctchargen@v1.0.0-beta.1` is the
way in.

### What a referee will notice

- **Twenty NPCs stop reading as twenty copies.** The auto policy took the first
  weapon on the printed list every time — Body Pistol and Dagger, and nothing
  else, across thirty characters — and designated Advanced Education every time
  it was offered. Over the same thirty it now names twenty-one distinct weapons
  and uses all four skills tables. A character generated under the default no
  longer goes his whole career without raising a characteristic.
- **`batch` says what it did**, on standard error so it cannot corrupt the
  JSONL: `100 written, 76 died`. That is the rules working — the default
  strategy re-enlists until the survival throw gets him — but a directory of
  corpses with no word about it was a trap.
- **`--survivors`** passes over the dead and goes on to the next seed, so
  "twenty scouts for the starport" is one command. It rerolls nobody: each
  character written is still exactly what his own seed makes, and
  `new --seed <that>` brings him back. The seeds are simply no longer
  consecutive.
- **`batch` streams.** `ctchargen batch --count 50000 --auto | jq` produces its
  first record immediately rather than after the run.
- **Two flags that were quietly ignored are refused**: `--sheet --history`
  together, and a word typed after a help flag.

### What changed in the record

The record now names **its own shape** and **the policy that answered it**, so
two records from one seed can be told apart by why they differ rather than only
that they do. A roll with nothing to meet — the draft die, a skills table, a
mustering out roll — is its own event kind rather than a throw recorded as
having "succeeded" against nothing.

`docs/character.schema.json` describes all of it, and every golden is validated
against it.

### What this tag does not promise

**The record is not frozen.** `v1.0.0` means two things and only the first
holds today: a referee can trust what the tool prints at the table, and the
record is frozen and supported. A record written by this build is not promised
to be readable by the next until that tag.

### Notes

**Do not install `v1.0.0-alpha.1` or `v1.0.0-alpha.2`.** Both predate the
rebuild at `41a213a` and are builds of a different implementation.

`docs/PRERELEASE.md` carries the full account, including the review that
preceded this tag and what it kept finding.

## v1.0.0-alpha.5 — 2026-09-04

The tag that closes the referee's alpha report. Every finding of
[#26](https://github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/issues/26) is answered, and this
is the first release whose binaries are attached by CI rather than by hand.

### Install

A binary, needing no Go toolchain:

```sh
curl -Lo ctchargen https://github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha.5/ctchargen-v1.0.0-alpha.5-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ctchargen
```

Substitute `darwin-amd64`, `linux-amd64` or `linux-arm64` in the filename for
another machine; `checksums.txt` is attached beside them. A **browser**
download is quarantined and needs `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ctchargen`
first — `curl` is not, which is why the line above is one. The binaries are
**unsigned**, so a recent macOS may refuse one regardless; if it does, the tool
is not broken and `go install github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/cmd/ctchargen@v1.0.0-alpha.5`
is the way in.

### What a referee will notice

- **The sheet prints the seed**, so a character you liked can be generated
  again — and the footer stops offering a command for a character the seed
  cannot bring back.
- **The headline says whose service it is.** Where you named one, it says the
  policy did not choose it; where the draft placed him after a refused
  enlistment, it names the service that refused him.
- **A session that stops offers the way back in.** Ctrl-D or a closed pipe
  halfway through generation now prints the seed and the answers you gave, and
  `--answers 1,2,1` replays them to the question you stopped on. A half-built
  character is still not a record — but a long session is no longer retyped.
- **Interactive generation reads straight.** Event numbers no longer skip, the
  two Advanced Education menu entries are told apart, and a non-numeric answer
  is complained about by name instead of silently re-printing the menu.
- **A one-term character no longer prints "1 terms".**
- **Errata are off the sheet.** They stay in the record and in the transcript,
  where an id can be looked up; on the sheet they were ids a reader could not
  expand.
- **The regenerate line quotes what it pastes.** A record is a file people
  share, and its fields were reaching your shell unquoted.

### What ships open, and why

**This tag departs from the shipping bar** stated in
[`docs/PRERELEASE.md`](https://github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/blob/v1.0.0-alpha.5/docs/PRERELEASE.md),
as alpha.4 did and for the same reason: #41, #42 and #43 are still open. All
three are structural findings from the prerelease code audit (#27) about the
shape of the code, and none of them changes a character the tool generates.
They are the next milestone's first work.

Also open: `batch` and the record's shape (#33, #34, #44, #46, #50, #76), and
housekeeping (#51–#60, #83, #84). #76 matters more than its number suggests —
the record does not yet name its own shape, so the freeze promised at `v1.0.0`
has nothing to attach to.

That document's alpha.5 section carries the full account, including the review
that preceded this tag: no whole-tool pass, but a review per PR, three of which
in a row caught a regression introduced while fixing something else.

### Notes

**Do not install `v1.0.0-alpha.1` or `v1.0.0-alpha.2`.** Both predate the
rebuild at `41a213a` and are builds of a different implementation.

alpha.4's binaries were built locally and uploaded after the fact; its notes
say so. These come from `release.yml`, which checks out this tag itself.

## v1.0.0-alpha.4 — 2026-09-04

The tool describes itself now.

```sh
go install github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/cmd/ctchargen@v1.0.0-alpha.4
```

Go excludes prereleases from `@latest`, so an alpha installs by name. That is
the intended friction.

> **Do not install `v1.0.0-alpha.1` or `v1.0.0-alpha.2`.** Both predate the
> rebuild at `41a213a` and are builds of a **different implementation** — they
> have a `replay` subcommand and flags this tool does not. Their notes are
> accurate about the tag they head and describe nothing here. They are not an
> upgrade path; this tag is a fresh install.

### Every command lists its own flags

This is the first finding of a Classic Traveller referee's alpha report (#26),
and the one his verdict named first. Before this tag, `new --help` and
`batch -h` printed `usage: flag: help requested` and exited 1, `--help` at top
level read as a mistyped subcommand, and there was no flag list anywhere.

```
$ ctchargen --help
usage: ctchargen <command> [flags]

  new      generate one character, asking at every choice unless --auto
  batch    generate many characters from one base seed, under --auto
  render   write a record saved earlier as a sheet or as a transcript
  version  write the build

Run `ctchargen <command> --help` for that command's flags.
```

`ctchargen new --help` lists all eleven of its flags with their descriptions,
**their values and their defaults** — which matters here, because the notes for
`v1.0.0-alpha.2` documented three strategies that were later renamed, and a
reader following that page had no way to find out from the tool.

### A typo no longer becomes a session

`ctchargen new extra-arg` used to ignore the word and start an interactive
generation on a seed nobody chose. Every command refuses a word it was not
expecting now.

**This narrows accepted input in one place:** `ctchargen version junk` was
accepted at exit 0 and is an error here. **That is not settled** — #70 is open
precisely to decide whether it keeps the refusal, softens it to unknown flags
only, or reverts. Shipping this tag is not a verdict on it.

### The README says how to install it

It never did. It opened with four `ctchargen …` lines and never said how
`ctchargen` gets onto a path, and it documented about a third of the flags. It
now carries an install section, all four commands, and recipes that use the
flags it never mentioned — including `batch` with no `-o`, which writes NDJSON
to standard output.

An unknown strategy is also refused in words rather than by pointing at a
repository file:

```
before: no such strategy: --muster "benefits"; POLICY.md carries [cash goods spartan]
after:  no such strategy: --muster "benefits"; want cash, goods, spartan
```

### Still alpha, and what that means here

[`docs/PRERELEASE.md`](https://github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/blob/v1.0.0-alpha.4/docs/PRERELEASE.md)
carries the full list. In short: three high findings from the code audit (#41,
#42, #43) are open, and this tag departs from that document's own shipping bar
to say so. All three are structural — about the shape of the code — and none of
them changes a character the tool generates. The rest of the referee's report
is open too, the seed absent from the character sheet (#32) being the next one
answered.

The engine is the part that has earned trust: determinism holds, the book's own
worked character (pp. 23–25) replays against it, and the 1977 death rule is
implemented as printed. Everything around the engine is still alpha.

### Binaries

Attached after the fact, and **built locally rather than by CI** — the release
workflow that produces them lands after this tag, so from the next release the
assets come from a runner checking out the tag itself. Both routes stamp the
same version; the difference is only in what a downloader is trusting, and it
is recorded here rather than left to look identical.

`checksums.txt` covers every binary beside it.

`--auto` can now be steered.

```sh
go install github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/cmd/ctchargen@v1.0.0-alpha.2
```

### Named strategies

Three rows of the policy are selectable, and the defaults are unchanged — a record generated without these flags differs from an `alpha.1` record only in its version stamps.

```sh
ctchargen new --auto --skills rounded          # a term improving himself, a term learning
                                               # the trade, a term specialising
ctchargen batch --count 20 --auto --skills advanced --career 4
```

| Flag       | Values                                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--skills` | `service` (default) · `personal` · `advanced` · `rounded` |
| `--muster` | `cash` (default) · `benefits`                             |
| `--career` | `max` (default) · a term 1–7 to leave after               |

**Why `--skills` matters.** The default always chose Service Skills, which meant a character never rolled on Personal Development — so never gained a characteristic in service — and never rolled on Advanced Education, putting Medical, Navigation, Computer, Leader and Administration out of reach outside the p. 23 rank grants. It compounded: the fourth table needs Education 8+, and Education rises only on Personal Development.

Across 30 characters from one base seed:

|                     | in-service characteristic gains | distinct skills                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| default             | 1                               | 13                                          |
| `--skills rounded`  | **53**                          | 15                                          |
| `--skills advanced` | 0                               | **18** (reaches the Education 8+ table 55×) |

`--career` sets **intent, not outcome**: the reenlistment throw is still required each term (p. 6) and a 12 exactly still forces another term (pp. 6–7). `--muster benefits` never rolls for cash, so the character musters out with none.

Every strategy is a pure function of the choice it is handed, so the policy stays **total** and **deterministic** — same inputs, same character. [`docs/POLICY.md`](docs/POLICY.md) describes each one, and a gate holds the strategies the CLI accepts to the ones that document describes, in both directions.

### Breaking: record versions moved

`schema_version` **2 → 3** and `policy_version` **3 → 4**.

Which strategy generated a character is caller input, so it is recorded in the record's `inputs`; `policy_version` continues to name the document rather than the selection within it. The new fields are omitted when the defaults were used.

**Records written by `v1.0.0-alpha.1` need `replay --ignore-provenance` against this build.** That is the whole reason this tag follows so quickly — leaving the only tag behind the change would have hidden the break.

`engine_version` stays **0.6.0**: a strategy changes the character the way `--service` does, through input, not through the engine. No golden fixture moved.

### Still alpha

For the same reason as before: every defect found in review has come from reading a held page, not from running a test. `v1.0.0` waits on characters generated in anger against the book.

## v1.0.0-alpha.1 — 2026-08-30

> [!WARNING]
> **Superseded — do not install this.** This release is a build of an

> this tag installs.

---

The full Classic Traveller prior-service procedure of **Book 1 pp. 4–25**, generated against the held © 1977 text: characteristics, enlistment and the draft, terms with survival, commissions, promotions and skills, aging and the medical crisis, mustering out with ships and titles. Death is an outcome, not an error — the dead get complete records too.

```sh
go install github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/cmd/ctchargen@v1.0.0-alpha.1
```

Go excludes prereleases from `@latest`, so the alpha installs by name. That is the intended friction.

### What it does

```sh
ctchargen new --auto                        # one character, policy decides, JSON to stdout
ctchargen new --seed 42 --service navy      # interactive: you answer each choice
ctchargen batch --count 20 --auto -o npcs.jsonl
ctchargen render character.json             # Markdown character sheet
ctchargen render --history character.json   # the full generation transcript
ctchargen replay character.json             # verify a record reproduces exactly
```

The JSON record is canonical; the Markdown is a render of it. Every record carries its seed, versions, inputs, and the complete event log, and `replay` re-runs the engine from the seed and recorded choices, exiting non-zero at the first divergence.

### What is verified

Every rule carries a printed-page cite, and every interpretation is recorded in [`docs/ERRATA.md`](docs/ERRATA.md) with its cite and **stamped on the records it governed** — E001 through E009, so a record says which readings shaped it.

The rule data was checked cell by cell against the held pages: the Prior Service Table, the Table of Ranks, all 24 acquired-skills tables, both mustering-out tables, the Aging Table, the Rank and Service Skills box, the retirement pay table, both weapons lists, and Book 3's Nobility table.

The book's own worked example reproduces. Jamison (p. 25): UPP 779C99, four merchant-ship receipts becoming a 30-year-old ship owing 10 years of payments, CR 4,000 retirement, two extra muster rolls at rank 5, aging saves at 34 and 38.

[`docs/COVERAGE.md`](docs/COVERAGE.md) maps every rule to its cite, implementation, and test. [`docs/POLICY.md`](docs/POLICY.md) is the auto mode's decision table. [`docs/PRERELEASE_REVIEW.md`](docs/PRERELEASE_REVIEW.md) is the v1.0.0 bar and the evidence for each line of it.

### Why alpha

Because the remaining instrument is use. Every defect found in the last three review passes was found by **reading a held page**, not by running a test — a page cite that was wrong in ten places including every titled record's event log, and a rules interpretation that had been applied silently since the beginning. What the suite can prove, it now proves; the rest needs characters generated in anger.

`v1.0.0` follows when use against the book turns up nothing the suite missed.

### Versions

`engine_version` 0.6.0, `schema_version` 2, `policy_version` 3. These track record behaviour rather than releases and are independent of this tag — `engine_version` changes when generation behaviour or any event's text changes, because `replay` compares whole events.
