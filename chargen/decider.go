// Package chargen walks Book 1's character generation procedure, pp. 4-25.
//
// It consumes a Decider for every point at which the procedure asks, and a
// roller for every point at which it throws. Nothing here decides on its own
// behalf: interactive mode, auto mode, and the tests each supply a Decider,
// and the engine cannot tell them apart.

// Decider answers every question the procedure asks.
//
// There is one method per choice point, each typed to its own alphabet, and
// that is what closes the set: adding a choice point breaks every
// implementation at compile time. Spelling it as one method over a label
// would lose exactly that.
//
// docs/POLICY.md carries one row per method — what the offered set is, when
// the engine asks, and what each named auto strategy answers — and the gate
// in internal/docsgate holds the two to each other in both directions.
//
// A method is called only when more than one answer is legal. A question
// with one answer is not a choice, and asking it would put an entry in the
// generation record that no reader could have decided differently.
//
// One method per choice point is what closes the set: twelve methods is
// twelve places the procedure asks, and a count is the wrong measure of that.
