// The worked example of Book 1 pp. 23-25, replayed.
//
// FR9 makes the instrument free: the procedure asks through a Decider and
// throws through a Roller, so a scripted pair walks the example's own
// character and the result is compared against the page. It is the one check
// on this engine written by someone other than its author.
//
// Every value below is read from pp. 23-25. The page's own arithmetic is
// inconsistent in four places, and the comment says so at each: a "DM of +7"
// its own sum corrects to +1; a survival "rolls 2 (+2=11)", whose total
// needs a 9; a promotion failure "by two points" that is one; and a "Table
// 7" among four tables. Where a stated roll and a stated total disagree the
// script follows the total, because the total is what the narrated outcome
// turns on.

// errNotNarrated is what a scripted answer returns on a path the example
// does not narrate. The t.Fatal above it stops the test first; this is what
// keeps the signature honest rather than returning a value nobody chose.
