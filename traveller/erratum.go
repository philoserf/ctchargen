//
// Every place the held text is silent, ambiguous, or self-contradictory has
// a reading recorded there with its page cite and its stamping condition,
// and the reading is named on every record it governed. A reading applied
// with neither an entry nor a stamp is the one defect no comparison between
// the documents and the code can find.
//
// Ids are stable: never reused, never renumbered. A withdrawn reading keeps
// its constant and its heading.
//
// The gate in internal/docsgate holds these constants and ERRATA.md's
// headings to each other in both directions.
