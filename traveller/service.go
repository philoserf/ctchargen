// Rank is a character's position in his service's Table of Ranks (p. 10).

// Rank 0 is "not commissioned", not a missing value. The highest rank is the
// service's own: the table does not run to the same length in every column,
// and two of the six have no ranks at all (p. 10, "Ranks, commissions, and
// promotions are non-existent in the scout and other services"). So the
// ceiling is data with a cite, in the rules package, not a bound here.

// Term is a term of service's ordinal, counting from 1 (p. 5).
//
// There is deliberately no upper bound. Seven is the cap on voluntary
// service (p. 7), and a 12 on the reenlistment throw puts a character past
// it (pp. 6-7) — repeatedly, per E003. The cap is a rule applied at a choice
// point; a type that stopped at 7 would reject a character the book permits.
type Term int

// Years is the length of one term of service: "a term of service lasting 4
// years" (p. 5).
