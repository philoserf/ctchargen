// The sums: the places where "exactly one of" is the rule.
//
// Each is an interface with a Fold method taking a cases interface that has
// one method per case, and an unexported seal so the set cannot be extended
// from outside this package. Adding a case adds a method to the cases
// interface, and every implementation stops compiling until it handles it.
//
// This is the same mechanism the Decider uses for choice points, and it is
// here for the same reason: Go's compiler does not check that a type switch
// covers every implementation of an interface, and neither does the
// exhaustive linter. A type switch over a sealed interface is an
// exhaustiveness promise that nothing keeps.

// Enlistment is how — or whether — a character entered a service (p. 5).

// prints both "he may submit to the draft" and "the character must submit to
// the draft", and the may reading governs.
