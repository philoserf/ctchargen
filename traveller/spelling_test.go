// No two values of an alphabet share a spelling.
//
// This is the assumption chargen's FR9 gate rests on. logging.record refuses
// an answer that was not offered by comparing rendered names, not values: the
// decorator holds both the offered set and the answer, and checking there
// leaves one definition of "answered outside the offer" rather than one per
// application site. That check is sound exactly as long as String() is
// injective on every alphabet the engine puts in an offered set.
//
// It was true when the gate was written and stated nowhere (#48). Two values
// that spelled the same would let a decider answer with one and have the
// other recorded, and nothing anywhere would notice.
//
// Every alphabet is here, not only the ones a Decider offers today, because
// what makes one reachable is a method signature - and a method that starts
// offering PassageClasses should not also have to remember this file.
//
// "Every" is a claim, so it is held rather than asserted in a comment: the
// test below reads this package's own source for the alphabets it declares
// and fails on one nobody checks here.
