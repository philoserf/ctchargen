// The shape a reader gets back is the shape that was written.
//
// eventCodec produces two things from one fold: the per-kind struct that goes
// on the wire, and the flat shape the transcript and the live view both read.
// There used to be a second codec producing the second of those, mapping the
// same domain fields a second time. Fold caught a fifth kind - both codecs
// stopped compiling - but not a field: liveCodec could stop carrying DM and
// only a transcript golden would notice (#46).
//
// One mapping is not enough on its own, because flat is still assigned field
// by field. This is what holds it: unmarshal what was written and compare.
// A field dropped from flat fails here, naming the kind.
