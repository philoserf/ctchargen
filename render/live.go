// EventLine renders one event for a reader watching a generation happen
// rather than reading it afterwards.
//
// Throws and outcomes go through the same writeEvent the transcript does:
// the wire shape and the domain shape both converge on eventJSON before
// anything is written, so those lines cannot come to differ.
//
// Steps and choices are written here instead, and deliberately do differ.
// A step's heading is unnumbered in the transcript, and a choice used to
// render as nothing at all here; either leaves a gap a watcher reads as a
// lost event, so both are written with their number. The choice is echoed
// as that number and the answer alone rather than the transcript's full
// form, because the player has just been asked the question and can still
// see the point, the decider and the alternatives above him; repeating them
// pushes the useful lines off the screen.
//
// It returns no error, as foldDeparture does not: the codec's cases fill
// struct fields and marshal shapes that cannot fail to marshal, and
// traveller.Event is sealed, so no fifth case can arrive from outside to fail
// either. An error return here would be a branch no test could reach.
