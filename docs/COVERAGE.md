# COVERAGE: the procedure, mapped to the code

2026-09-03. Every milestone complete. Companion to `PRD.md`.

Every rule of Book 1 pp. 4–25 that this tool implements, with the page that
governs it, the code that carries it, and the test that holds it. A rule with
no row here is a rule that is not implemented; a row with no test is a defect.

Every table of pp. 4–25 is lifted and every one is consulted, and each is
transcribed twice — once in `rules/data`, once in the `rules` tests, from
the same visual reading of the page.

## What the engine walks

All six services. P. 10 makes ranks, commissions and promotions one fact —
"Ranks, commissions, and promotions are non-existent in the scout and other
services" — so the four that print a rank column have all three, and the two
that print none have none.

The book's own worked character (pp. 23–25) is replayed against the engine,
and Book 2 pp. 18–19 give the two ships the benefits name.
