# ctchargen

A Go CLI that generates rules-accurate Classic Traveller characters.

Ruleset baseline: **Books 1–3 only** — the FFE reprints of the © 1977 text.
Character generation is Book 1 pp. 4–25; Books 2 and 3 are consulted only
where Book 1 points at them. Every implemented rule carries its printed-page
cite, and every place the text is silent or ambiguous has a recorded reading.

## Install

A binary, needing no Go toolchain. This is the line for an Apple-silicon Mac:

```sh
curl -Lo ctchargen https://github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha.4/ctchargen-v1.0.0-alpha.4-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ctchargen
```

For another machine, substitute `darwin-amd64`, `linux-amd64` or `linux-arm64`
in the filename. The tag is named rather than `releases/latest`, which resolves
only to a non-prerelease and so resolves to nothing here. A `checksums.txt` is
attached beside the binaries.

`curl` is what the line uses because a **browser** download is quarantined and
needs `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ctchargen` before it will run. The
binaries are also **unsigned**, so a recent macOS may refuse one regardless —
if it does, the tool is not broken; install it with Go instead:

```sh
go install github.com/philoserf/ctchargen/cmd/ctchargen@v1.0.0-alpha.4
```

Go excludes prereleases from `@latest`, so an alpha installs by name. That is
the intended friction.

**Do not install `v1.0.0-alpha.1` or `v1.0.0-alpha.2`.** Both predate the
rebuild at `41a213a` and are builds of a different implementation — they have
a `replay` subcommand and flags this tool does not. Their release notes are
accurate about the tag they head and describe nothing below.

From a clone:

```sh
go build ./cmd/ctchargen
```

## Status

All six services generate, the book's own worked character (pp. 23–25)
replays against the engine, the record has a schema, and characters can be
written to files, generated in batches and read back. `new` without
`--auto` walks the procedure a question at a time, showing each throw
between the questions.

Every command lists its own flags, which is where the current set lives:

```sh
ctchargen --help          # the commands
ctchargen new --help      # one command's flags, with their values and defaults
```

## Using it

Four commands. `new` generates one character; `batch` generates many from one
base seed; `render` reads a record back as a sheet or as the transcript; and
`version` writes the build.

```sh
ctchargen new --auto --seed 145 --service merchants --sheet
ctchargen new --auto --name "Alexander Jamison" -o jamison.json
ctchargen new --auto --history                  # the transcript, throw by throw
ctchargen new --seed 145 --sheet                # asks at every choice point

ctchargen batch --count 20 --auto --seed 145 --service merchants
ctchargen batch --count 20 --auto --seed 145 --service merchants -o characters/

ctchargen render characters/00000000000000000145.json
ctchargen render --history characters/00000000000000000145.json
```

Batch members number from zero, so the first of that batch is the character
the first `new` above generated, and `render` shows the same sheet.

**`batch` with no `-o` writes NDJSON to standard output**, one record to the
line, which is the shape that pipes:

```sh
ctchargen batch --count 100 --auto --seed 145 | jq -r '[.upp, .service, .terms] | @tsv'
```

`batch` requires `--auto`, because it has nobody to ask.

**A session that stops before the end offers the way back in.** A half-built
character is not a record, so it cannot be written out — but the seed and the
answers already given are enough to walk back to the question you stopped on,
and those are what a long session cannot retype:

```sh
$ ctchargen new --seed 7 --service other
...
Re-run the same command with --seed 7 --answers 1,2,1 to pick up at this question.
```

`--answers` replays those and then asks the next question as normal. It is the
same command deliberately: an answer is a number in the list a question
offered, so a re-run that drops `--service` or `--name` asks a different
sequence and spends the answers on it. A list longer than the run has
questions for is refused rather than half-applied, and `--answers` cannot be
given with `--auto`, which answers every question itself.

**Without `--service` the tool picks one**, and with `--auto` that pick is the
policy's rather than yours. The sheet says so on its headline, and so does the
record. Naming a service does not guarantee you get it either: a failed
enlistment throw sends the character to the draft, which may put him somewhere
else entirely — the sheet says that too.

**Three flags steer `--auto`** where the procedure offers a choice, on both
`new` and `batch`. [`docs/POLICY.md`](docs/POLICY.md) carries a row per choice
point saying what each one does:

| Flag       | Values                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--career` | `serve` (default) · `retire` · `oneterm`      |
| `--skills` | `advanced` (default) · `service` · `personal` |
| `--muster` | `cash` (default) · `goods` · `spartan`        |

**Nothing is overwritten without `--force`.** `-o` onto an existing file is
refused, and so is a `batch` any of whose members would replace one — the
whole batch, before a byte is written, so a refusal leaves the directory as it
was.

Death is an outcome and not an error: a character killed by a survival throw
(Book 1 p. 5) gets a complete record like anyone else, and no flag rerolls him.

## The gate

```sh
task
```

`go mod tidy -diff`, `go vet`, golangci-lint, NilAway, `go test -race`, and a
coverage ratchet that holds each package's count of uncovered statements. CI
runs exactly this.

The toolchain is unpinned on purpose, and golangci-lint runs with
`default: all`, so a linter added upstream arrives switched on. Formatting is
`gofumpt`, run _inside_ golangci-lint rather than beside it, so there is one
definition of formatted rather than two that can disagree.
